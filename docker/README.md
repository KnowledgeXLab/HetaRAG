## Docker Environment Configuration

The default versions of various components used in the Docker environment, installed via `docker-compose.yml`.

### Default Versions

- **Docker**: 4.35.0  
- **Elasticsearch**: 7.17.1  
- **Kibana**: 7.17.1  
- **Milvus**: 2.4.0  
- **etcd**: 3.5.5  
- **MinIO**: RELEASE.2024-09-13T20-26-02Z  
- **Attu**: 2.4.0  
- **Neo4j**: 5.26.0
- **MySQL**: 5.7

### Notes

If the Docker version is too high (e.g., 4.38.0), Elasticsearch may encounter cgroup errors during startup.  
In this case, you can try upgrading Elasticsearch to version 7.17.26 by updating the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## ðŸ“Œ Quick start
Create volume directories under the `docker` directoryï¼š
```bash
cd docker
mkdir -p elastic/data
mkdir -p milvus
mkdir -p neo4j
mkdir -p mysql/data
```
- Modify the `kibana.yml` file in the kibana folder and change the `elasticsearch.hosts` to your own IP address
- And change the password of elastic below to the password you want to set later (in the second step). (The default password is elastic).
Start Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This command will download and start the following containers:

- elasticsearch: For full-text search and document indexing
- milvus: For vector similarity search
- minio: For object storage
- etcd: For distributed key-value storage
- kibana: For elasticsearch visualization

All images will be downloaded to Docker's default image storage location (/var/lib/docker/). Total size ~2GB, may take 5-10 minutes depending on your network speed.

If the following words are displayed, it indicates that the download is complete.

Check the service operation status
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
When you see output similar to this, all services have been successfully started, 
elasticsearch runs on port 9200, and milvus runs on port 19530:

```

You need to enter the Elasticsearch container! (This is executed on Docker Desktop. You can also use the terminal to enter the Docker container for operations.)
![4](./imgs/4.png) 

![5](./imgs/5.png)

Enter the command in the exec in its container:

```sh
bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
```

Change the password. There should be 5-6 users who need to change their passwords. It is recommended to change them all to the same.(I changed all the passwords to "elastic" for consistency.)

The configuration is completed. Open the kibana container (or just wait without opening it). The interface will output kibana is available to enter port 5601. It can be used.
