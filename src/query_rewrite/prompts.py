QUERY_REWRITE_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful assistant that generates multiple search queries based on a single input query.

Perform query expansion. If there are multiple common ways of phrasing a user question or common synonyms for key words in the question, make sure to return multiple versions of the query with the different phrasings.
If there are acronyms or words you are not familiar with, do not try to rephrase them.
Return 3 different versions of the question.
Do not include any other text or explanation.

---Output Format Requirements---
Return the queries as a JSON object with a key "queries" and a list of strings as the value.
The output should strictly follow this format:
{{
  "queries": [
    "Expanded_Query_1",
    "Expanded_Query_2",
    "Expanded_Query_3"
  ]
}}

---Example---
Input Query: Were Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood of the same nationality?

---Output---:  
{{
  "queries": [
    "What is Scott Derrickson's nationality?",
    "What is Ed Wood's nationality?",
    "Are Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood from the same country?"
  ]
}}
